# Auto profiles {{{1
#
#     Some profiles are loaded automatically. The following example demonstrates this:

#        Auto profile loading

#            [vo.vdpau]
#            # Use hardware decoding
#            hwdec=vdpau

#            [protocol.dvd]
#            profile-desc="profile for dvd:// streams"
#            alang=en

#            [extension.flv]
#            profile-desc="profile for .flv files"
#            vf=flip

#            [ao.alsa]
#            device=spdif

# The profile name follows the schema type.name, where type can be:
#
#     • vo to match the value the --vo option is set to
#     • ao for --ao
#     • protocol for the input/output protocol  in use  (see --list-protocols)
#     • extension  for the extension of the path of the currently played file (not the file format)

# This feature is very limited, and there are no other auto profiles.

# subtitles {{{1

# load ALL  subs containing  media filename,  not just the  only one  having the
# exact same name (useful when we have `file.fr.srt` and `file.en.srt`)
sub-auto=fuzzy

# What's the purpose of `sub-file-paths`?{{{
#
# Suppose you've a movie whose subtitles are not in the same directory;
# they're in a `subs/a` subdirectory.
#
# `mpv` won't load them.
# Solution:
#     sub-file-paths=subs/a
#
# Suppose you've another one whose subtitles are in a `subs/b` subdirectory.
# Now you have to set the option like this:
#
#     sub-file-paths=subs/a:subs/b
#}}}
# What's the meaning of the `**` value?{{{
#
# Every time we find a new type of name for our subtitles subdirectory,
# we have to add it to `sub-file-paths`.
# It's annoying.
# With the help of this script:
#
#     https://github.com/dya-tel/mpv-scripts#fuzzydirlua
#
# We  can  use  the  value  `**`  to  let `mpv`  know  that  it  must  scan  all
# subdirectories regardless of their name.
