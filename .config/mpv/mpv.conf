# Auto profiles {{{1
#
#     Some profiles are loaded automatically. The following example demonstrates this:

#        Auto profile loading

#            [vo.vdpau]
#            # Use hardware decoding
#            hwdec=vdpau

#            [protocol.dvd]
#            profile-desc="profile for dvd:// streams"
#            alang=en

#            [extension.flv]
#            profile-desc="profile for .flv files"
#            vf=flip

#            [ao.alsa]
#            device=spdif

# The profile name follows the schema type.name, where type can be:
#
#    - vo to match the value the --vo option is set to
#    - ao for --ao
#    - protocol for the input/output protocol  in use  (see --list-protocols)
#    - extension  for the extension of the path of the currently played file (not the file format)

# This feature is very limited, and there are no other auto profiles.

# load subs whose name contain the name of the video file
# What kind of subs does 'fuzzy' make mpv automatically load?{{{
#
# As an example, 'fuzzy' would allow mpv to automatically load `my_movie.fr.srt`
# and `my_movie.en.srt`.
#}}}
#   What's its limitation?{{{
#
# If your video file is named  `my_movie.mkv`, 'fuzzy' doesn't allow mpv to load
# `Subtitles/English.srt`, because `my_movie` is absent from `English`.
#}}}
# How to load all subtitles?{{{
#
# Use the value 'all'.
#}}}
#   Why don't you use this other value?{{{
#
# It loads too many irrelevant files.
#}}}
# What's the default value of the 'sub-auto' option?{{{
#
# 'exact'
#
# It means that by default, mpv  only loads subtitles whose name matches exactly
# the name of the movie file.
#}}}
sub-auto=fuzzy

# What's the purpose of `sub-file-paths`?{{{
#
# Suppose you've a movie whose subtitles are not in the same directory;
# they're in a `subs/a` subdirectory.
#
# `mpv` won't load them.
# Solution:
#     sub-file-paths=subs/a
#
# Suppose you've another one whose subtitles are in a `subs/b` subdirectory.
# Now you have to set the option like this:
#
#     sub-file-paths=subs/a:subs/b
#}}}
# What's the meaning of the `**` value?{{{
#
# Every time we find a new type of name for our subtitles subdirectory,
# we have to add it to `sub-file-paths`.
# It's annoying.
# With the help of this script:
# https://github.com/dya-tel/mpv-scripts#fuzzydirlua
#
# We  can  use  the  value  `**`  to  let `mpv`  know  that  it  must  scan  all
# subdirectories regardless of their name.
#}}}
sub-file-paths=**

# Change subtitle encoding.
# If the file seems to be valid UTF-8, prefer UTF-8.
# (You can add '+' in front of the codepage to force it.)

# When should I change this option?{{{
#
# Probably if some characters in your subtitles aren't represented by any glyph.
# In this case, the issue may come from a wrong used codepage.
#}}}
# How is the codepage of the subtitles determined?{{{
#
# Here's the algorithm followed by `mpv`:
#
#    - if the specified codepage is prefixed by a +, use that codepage
#    - if the data looks like UTF-8, use UTF-8
#    - if `--sub-codepage` is set to a specific codepage, use that
#    - run `uchardet`, and if successful, use that
#    - use UTF-8-BROKEN
#          │
#          └ pseudo codepage used by `mpv` internally:
#
#                subtitles are interpreted as UTF-8,
#                with 'Latin 1' as fallback
#                for bytes which are not valid UTF-8 sequences
#}}}
# What are some examples of 'sub-codepage' settings?{{{
#
# Use Latin 2 if input is not UTF-8:
#
#    * sub-codepage=latin2
#
# Always force (+) recoding to cp1256:
#
#    * sub-codepage=+cp1256
#                    │
#                    └ adapted to arabic subtitles

# Why do you disable the OSC bar ?{{{
