# What's the aspect ratio?

The proportional relationship between the width and the height of your screen.

It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9.

By default, the `mpv` window probably inherits the aspect ratio of your screen.

# What's the `OSD`?

On-Screen Display:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-screen_display

It's the bar displaying the timestamp when we press `o`.

# What's the `OSC`?

On-Screen Control.

It's  the bar  displayed when  we pause  a  video, and  allowing us  to move  to
different timestamps via the mouse.

It provides us other features, all controlled via the mouse, such as cycling the
subtitles, or entering fullscreen mode.
