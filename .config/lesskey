# What's this file?{{{
#
# A config file that `lesskey(1)` can  compile into a binary format in `~/.less`.
# The latter is used by `less(1)` to change its config.

#
# > You can set your  own key bindings with the lesskey  program.  Create a file

# scroll to the left/right by pressing `h` and `l`

#
# > There is no command that scrolls one character left or right.
# > You can  do that by  passing the numeric argument  1 to the  left-scroll and
# > right-scroll commands.
#
# > You can't directly set a binding for a command with an argument, but you can
# > **set a binding to run a command and then parse more keys**.
# > So run the noaction command, then parse  a key sequence that runs the scroll
# > command with the desired arguments.

# Also, from `man lesskey /PRECEDENCE`:
#
# > a key may be defined to do nothing by using the action "noaction".
#
# And from `man lesskey /COMMAND SECTION`:
#
# > An action may be followed by an "extra" string.
# > When such a command is entered  while running less, the action is performed,
# > and then the extra string is parsed, just as if it were typed in to less.
# > This feature can be  used in certain cases to extend  the functionality of a
# > command.

# Doesn't our `h` key binding shadow the default help command?{{{
#
# Yes, but you can stil get the help screen by pressing `H`.

h noaction 3\e(
l noaction 3\e)
