# Copy the selected text inside the CLIPBOARD clipboard{{{
#
# By default, when  we select some text  in zathura, it's copied  in the PRIMARY
# clipboard, which we  can access via the  `*` register. We want to  use the `+`
# register instead, because  it's more consistent with other  programs (like the
# browser).

#     /selection-clipboard
#
# The  'selection-clipboard'   option  defines   the  X  clipboard   into  which
# mouse-selected data  will be written.   When it is "clipboard",  selected data
# will be written to the CLIPBOARD clipboard, and can be pasted using the Ctrl+v
# key combination.  When  it is "primary", selected data will  be written to the
# PRIMARY clipboard,  and can be  pasted using the  middle mouse button,  or the
# Shift-Insert key combination.
#
# Default value: primary
