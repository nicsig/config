#
# When you run `touch(1)` to create  a file, fasd doesn't register anything into
# its database, because the file doesn't exist yet.
# But if you run it on an existing file, fasd will register it.
# I don't like that, because I suspect I sometimes run `touch(1)` on an existing
# file while studying some shell concept.
