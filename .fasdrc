#
# When you run `$  touch` to create a file, fasd  doesn't register anything into
# its database, because the file doesn't exist yet.
# But if you run it on an existing file, fasd will register it.
# I don't like that, because I suspect  I sometimes run `$ touch` on an existing
# file while studying some shell concept.
