# Prevent xfce4 from saving & restoring a session.{{{
#
# It can happen even if you untick "Automatically save session on logout" in:
#
#     Settings
#     > Session and Startup
#     > General
#
# Maybe that's  because we sometimes forget  to untick "Save session  for future
# logins" in the GUI menu which pops up when we log out by pressing Alt-F4 while
# on the desktop...
#
# See: https://askubuntu.com/questions/427842/how-to-permanently-disable-the-save-session-feature-in-xubuntu
#
# In any case, when that happens, you may experience many issues.
#
# E.g.,  sometimes, the  desktop manager  (`xfdesktop(1)`) or  worse the  window
# manager (`xfwm4`)  process is not automatically  started when you boot  up the
# machine.
#
# Not sure,  but it  may also affect  the persistence of  a custom  cursor theme
# across reboots.  See `~/.icons/README.md`.
#
# ---
#
# Once,  the window  manager  was not  started, not  even  after restarting  the
# machine.  This lead to many issues.
#
# The cursor in  the terminal was not a  full block, but an empty  one (only the
# borders were drawn, not the inside).
#
# When starting tmux, its  status line position was too low; half  of it was not
# visible.
#
# After starting the web browser, I could not enter text anywhere, except in the
# browser whose window geometry was too small to be usable.
# The latter issue persisted across reboots.
# It was not  possible to administrate the  machine anymore; I had  to switch to
# the console and start `w3m(1)` to find a solution.
#

#
# Here is another issue which seems to confirm that this feature is buggy:
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-session/+bug/1215182
#
# I really don't want to rely on  such an unreliable feature, which can cause so
# many different issues.

# TODO: A better way to avoid this issue would be to purge the `xfce4-session` package.{{{
#
# If  you  purge  the package,  you'll  need  to  make  sure the  system  starts
# automatically some processes; in particular the current script.
# Check out:
#
#     Settings
#     > Session and Startup
#     > Application Autostart
#
# You  may want  to  make sure  that  some  (all?) of  the  processes which  are
# currently automatically started on login are still automatically started after
# purging the package.

# Why don't you use unclutter anymore?{{{
#
# It interfered with  the `interSubs` script which lets us  read the translation
# of subtitles.
#
# In the past, we used a shell function to toggle the process:
#
#     unclutter_toggle() {
#       emulate -L zsh
#       local pid
#       pid="$(pgrep unclutter)"

#       else
#         unclutter -idle 2 & disown
#       fi
#     }

#
# And indeed the source code of xbanish is shorter.
# Use `$ apt-get source` to get the source code of unclutter.

# First, we don't use urxvt as our default terminal emulator anymore.
# Second, sometimes, the terminal is slightly too high for the desktop.
# I think the issue comes from it being started automatically.

# Configure xterm. In  particular, make its  background identical to the  one in
