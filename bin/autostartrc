# Warning:{{{
#
# `unclutter` interferes with the `interSubs` script which allows us to read the
# translation of subtitles.
#
# Besides, it may cause issues in the future:

#     https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unclutter#Known_bugs
#
# If it happens, it  may be difficult to debug, because  `unclutter` seems to be
# an unimportant program, so I tend to forget its existence easily.

# I think the issue comes from it being started automatically.

# Purpose:{{{

# Configure xterm. In  particular, make its  background identical to the  one in
# urxvt (instead of black by default).
