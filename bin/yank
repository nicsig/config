#
#     OSC;c;?ST
#           ^
#           special parameter
#
# Usage example:
#
#     # write 'hello' in the clipboard
#     $ printf -- '\033]52;c;%s\007' "$(printf -- 'hello' | base64)"
#
#     # read the clipboard
#     $ printf -- '\033]52;c;?\007'
#     52;c;aGVsbG8=~
#
#     # decode the clipboard
#     $ base64 -d <<<'aGVsbG8='
#     hello~
#
# Note that `52;c;aGVsbG8=` is not written on printf's standard output (i.e. the
# terminal). Instead, it's written directly on the command-line.
# So, I don't know how to reduce the last 2 commands down to a one-liner;
# nor how to use it from a script...
#
# Also, note that st doesn't recognize this sequence. And so, upon receiving it,
# st clears its clipboard.

# TODO: What's the use of this script for someone who sets the tmux option 'set-clipboard' to 'on' or 'external'?

# What does this script do?{{{
#
# It writes arbitrary text in the clipboard selection.
#
# The source of the text can be:
#
#    - the terminal (what you type interactively)
#    - a pipe
#    - some file(s)
#
# ---
#
# If the script is run from a shell managed by tmux, it will also write the text
# in a tmux buffer (in addition to the clipboard selection).
#
# And if the  script is run from a  shell where `$DISPLAY` is set,  it will also
# try to write the text in the clipboard selection via `$ xclip` or `$ xsel`.

#   Where did you find it?{{{

#}}}
#   Why does it write in the clipboard selection via `$ xsel` *and* via OSC 52?{{{
#
# Most of the time, this is – indeed – redundant.
# That is, when you're  copying some short text from a local  shell, only one of
# these tools is necessary.
#
# However, there're 2 special cases where only one of them will work.
#
# - If the script is run locally, OSC 52 may truncate the text if it's too long (>75k).
#   In that case, `$ xsel` is useful as a more reliable fallback.
#
# - If the script is run on a remote server, there's probably no display server (Xorg).
#   In that case, `$ xsel` will fail.
#   And even if there  is a display server, you probably want to  copy the text in
#   the *local* clipboard selection, not the remote one.
#   Only OSC 52 can do that.
#}}}

# Usage:{{{
#
#     $ yank
#     $ cmd | yank
#     $ yank FILE ...
#
# In the first command, write your text, then press C-d twice:
#
#     $ yank
#     hello
#     C-d C-d
#}}}

# Why `$ cat`?{{{
#
# The input could be some file(s).
#}}}
#   Why does it still work when the input is not a file?{{{
#
# When the script's input is a pipe, or the terminal, `"$@"` is empty.
# And  `$ cat`,  without arguments,  reads its  standard input  – which  here is
# inherited from the script.
#
#     # the input is a pipe
#     $ echo 'text' | cat
#     text~
#
#     # the input is the terminal
#     $ cat
#     text
#     text~

# What's this `||:`?{{{

# Besides, there's an overhead of 8  bytes for the header (`\033]52;c;`) and the

# Finally, the text must be base64-encoded, which adds 33% of additional overhead:
#
#     77_994 * 4/3 = 99_992

# See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Output_padding> for the

  # To make `$ printf` translate `\033` and `\007` into `Esc` and `ST`.

  # it's inside an argument bound to any other specifier (like e.g. `%s`).
  #
  # From `$ man bash /printf /%b`:
  #
  # > %b     causes printf to expand backslash escape sequences in the

  # Is there a risk that some part of the sequence is wrongly interpreted as a backslash escape sequence (like `\007`)?{{{
  #
  # No, because the encoded text will never contain a backslash:
