# And maybe use update-alternatives to make Neovim our default editor in the future.

# TODO: The script has failed to compile the right Vim version in the past.
# I think  it happened because  we had checked  out a particular  commit without
# getting back to master before the compilation.
# Anyway, the issue was not obvious to understand.
# Add some messages to let us know when the script is doing what; like:
#
#     "running `$ git checkout master`"
#     "running `$ git pull`"

    # Why can aptitude overwrite our compiled package?{{{
    #
    # When aptitude  finds several  candidates for the  same package,  it checks
    # their version to decide which one is the newest.
    # By default, checkinstall uses the current date as the package version:
    #
    #     20180914
    #
    # This would cause an issue for Vim:
    #
    #     $ apt-cache policy vim
    #     vim:~
    #       Installed: (none)~
    #       Candidate: 2:8.0.0134-1ubuntu1~ppa1~x~

    #          2:8.0.0134-1ubuntu1~ppa1~x 500~
    #             500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/pi-rho/dev/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages~
    #     ...~
    #
    # Here the version of the Vim package in the ppa is `2:8.0.0134`.
    # If the version of our compiled package is `20180914`, it will be considered
    # older than the one in the ppa.
    # I think that's because the format of a date is different.
    # `apt` expects a number before a colon, but there's no colon in a date.
    # So it assumes that the date should be prefixed by `0:` or `1:` which gives:
    #
    #     0:20180914
    #         <
    #     2:8.0.0134-1ubuntu1~ppa1~x

    # Why don't you use `--pkgname="my{PGM}"` anymore?{{{
    #
    # When checkinstall tries to install `myPGM`, it may try to overwrite a file
    # belonging to `PGM` (it will probably  happen if `PGM` is already installed
    # in a different version).
    # If that happens, the installation will fail:
