#
# Since tmux 2.1, `default-terminal` is a server option, not a session option.
#
# > As a side-effect this changes default-terminal  to be a server rather than a
# > session option.
#
# https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/7382ba82c5b366be84ca55c7842426bcf3d1f521
# Confirmed by the  fact that `default-terminal` is described in  the section of
# the server options in the man page.
# Also confirmed by the fact that it's listed in the output of:
#
#     tmux show-options -s
#
# However, according to `nicm` (contributor of `tmux`):
#
# > You do not have to use -s or -w for set-option except for user options.
# > Tmux can work it out from the option name.
# > For show-option you do need it.
#
# So, we could omit `-s`, but I prefer to be explicit.
#}}}
# Why not let tmux use the default value `screen` (for `$TERM`)?{{{
#
# By default, most terminals set `$TERM` to `xterm` because the `xterm` entry is
# present and set in the terminfo db of most machines.
# `tmux` set it to `screen`, again, because  it's a popular entry (more than the
# `tmux` one).
# The `xterm`/`screen` value implies that the terminal will declare supporting
# only 8 colors. Confirmed by:    tput colors
#
# Because of this, the theme of some programs may be off (including Vim and the
# terminal itself). We want the terminal to declare it supports 256 colors,
# which anyway is usually true.
#}}}
# Do we need `$TERM` to contain `tmux`?{{{
#
# Yes. To support italics:
#
# The `screen-256color` entry in the terminfo db doesn't have a `sitm` field.
# IOW, the db reports that screen is unable to support italics, which is true.
# So, if we set `$TERM` to `screen-256color`, when an application will want to
# make some text appear italicized, it will think it's not possible.
# But it IS possible, because we use tmux, not screen. And tmux DOES support
# the italics style.
# The solution is to set `$TERM`  to `tmux-256color` so that when an application
# queries  the terminfo  db, it  finds  the field  `sitm` with  the right  value
# `\E[3m`.

# Do we need `$TERM` to contain `256color`?{{{
#
# For a Vim color scheme to be correctly applied, no.

# Why do you reset it?{{{

# Session {{{2

# Why?{{{
#
# If a new window is created without any command to execute, tmux reads the
# session option `default-command` to find one.
# By default,  its value  is an empty  string which instructs  tmux to  create a
# *login* shell using the value of the default-shell option.
# The default value of the latter is $SHELL (atm: /bin/zsh).
#
# When we create a new window, we  want a *non*-login shell, because a login zsh
# shell  sources `~/.zprofile`,  which  we use  to execute  code  specific to  a
# virtual *console* (set the background to white in the console).
# This code is not suited to a virtual *terminal*.
#
# More  generally, we  don't  want a  *non*-login shell  to  source login  files
# (`.profile`, `.zprofile`, `.zlogin`).
#
# So, we give the value zsh to `default-command` to prevent tmux from starting a
# login shell.

#
# The hook  is given as  an example in  `$ man tmux`;  its purpose is  to resize
# equally all the panes whenever you split a pane horizontally.
#}}}

# TODO: Install a hook to ignore the activity in a Vim or cmus window.{{{
#
# This works:
#
#     ps_cmd="ps -o state=,comm= -t '#{pane_tty}'"
#     vim_pat="g?(view|n?vim?x?)(diff)?"
#         set-hook -g pane-focus-in \

#         'setw monitor-activity off' \
#         'setw monitor-activity on'"
#
# But I'm  not comfortable with `$  ps` and `$  grep` being fired every  time we
# focus a different pane.
# I would prefer using `window-renamed`, which is much less frequent.
# The problem is that it's also less reliable.
#
# MWE: Open two windows.
#
# In the first one run:
#
#     $ tmux show-options -w
#     ''~
#
# In the second one run:
#
#     $ sleep 3
#
# And get back to the first.
# Wait for the sleep to end in the other window, and run:
#
#     $ tmux show-options -w
#     monitor-activity on~
#
# The option has been set. It shouldn't.
#
# This is because:
#
#    - when sleep ends running, its window is renamed (sleep → zsh)
#    - the hook is run in the context of the current window, instead of the renamed window
#
# We need a way to make the command target the window which is renamed, probably
# using the `-t` option of `setw`.
# How to get a description (session name  + window index) of the window which is
# renamed?

#
# > In Vim,  you can refer  to the  buffer name where  an autocmd is  fired with

# Rebind {{{1

# Purpose:{{{
#
# The tmux-yank plugin installs this key binding:
#
#     bind-key -T copy-mode-vi Y  send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "tmux paste-buffer"
#
# It copies the selection, quit copy mode, then paste the buffer.
#
# However, it doesn't support the bracketed paste mode.
# So we  redefine the key binding,  and pass `-p` to  `paste-buffer` to surround
# the text with the sequences `Esc [ 200 ~` and `Esc [ 201 ~`.
# This way, if we  select a text containing a newline, then  press `Y`, it's not
# automatically run by the shell.
#
# From `$ man tmux /paste-buffer`:
#
# > If -p  is specified,  paste bracket  control codes  are inserted  around the
# > buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.
#
# Note that this requires that the shell supports the bracketed paste mode.
# I.e. if you're using  zsh, you need zsh version 5.1 or  greater, and if you're
# using bash, you need bash 4.4 or greater.
#
# ---
#
# The `-p` option was added to tmux in the commit `f4fdddc`.
# According to the changelog, this was somewhere between tmux 1.6 and 1.7.
#
# ---
#
# Note that  the original key binding used `copy-pipe-and-cancel`  which – while
# working – doesn't make sense; you can't pipe anything to `$ tmux paste-buffer`,
# since it doesn't read its input.
