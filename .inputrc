# It doesn't work!{{{

# Make sure that your bash version > 4.4, and that your readline version > 7.

#   Our current bash is too old!  Why don't you update it?{{{
#
# Yes, I know, our current bash on Ubuntu 16.04 is 4.3.
# I tried  to compile  bash 5.0, but  after installing it,  some of  our scripts
# produced weird warning messages; sometimes the output was completely wrong.
#
# If you look  at the patches in  the source package (`$  apt-get source bash`),
# you'll see that the maintainer applies a lot of them.
# It's not easy to compile a perfectly working bash.
# And bash is essential; it must work perfectly.
#
# Don't try to compile. Last  time we tried, we broke the  package, and the only
# way to reinstall it, was to remove a bunch of files:
#
#     $ sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/bash*
#
# ---
#
# Why not compiling  into `/usr/local/` (which is what happens  by default btw),
# and thus avoid `/bin/bash`?
# We  could  keep  the latter  for  the  scripts,  and  use the  former  for  an
# interactive usage...
#
# Yes, but because of the difference of version, it would bring an inconsistency
# between what  we try  in an  interactive shell,  and what  we experiment  in a
# script; this would lead to too much confusion.
# Besides, what's the point of using a possibly *broken* interactive bash?

# What does it do?{{{
#
# From `$ man 3 readline /enable-keypad`:
#
# > When set to On, readline will try  to enable the application keypad when it is
# > called.  Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys.
#
# By default, when readline is called, the terminal is in normal mode.
# But  when  `enable-keypad` is  set,  readline  makes  the terminal  enter  the
# application mode temporarily.
#
# For more info about normal vs application mode:
# http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.faq.html#xterm_arrows
# http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-PC-Style-Function-Keys
#
# For more  info about  the delete  key issue, see  our comments  in `~/.zshrc`,
# somewhere around the key binding which invokes `delete-char`.
#}}}
#   Why do you do this?{{{

# It's necessary to fix the delete key in the suckless terminal.

#
#     user@machine:~$ C-p
#     user@machine:~$ old command
#     *user@machine:~$ old command modified
#     ^
#     added because we've modified the command line by inserting 'modified' at its end

#     user@ubuntu:~$ printf 'foobar'
#     foobarjean@ubuntu:~$~

#     foobaruser@ubuntu:~$ printf 'foobar'~
#
#     press left arrow key, 4 times, then insert `x` (between foo and bar)
#     *user@ubuntu:~$ printf 'fooxbar'bar'~
#
# The issue is due to an interaction between `mark-modified-lines` and `$ printf`
# when the string it prints doesn't end with a new line.
# I think this is because, without trailing  newline, the start of the prompt is
# shifted to the right.
# In that regard, zsh is better, because, it never shifts the prompt.
# If there's no trailing newline, it just adds a trailing percent (in standout style):
#
#     % printf 'foobar'
#     foobar%~

#
# readline provides several functions to modify the case of a word:
#
#    * M-c    capitalize
#    * M-l    downcase
#    * M-u    upcase
#
# Unfortunately, we can't use some of  them because they're already used in tmux
# / fzf.
# So, we want to use `M-u` as a prefix to change the case of a word.
# We do it in this file, instead of `~/.bashrc`, because this way, we can affect
# all the interpreters using readline. (lua, python, ...)
#}}}
# We start by removing the default key  binding using `M-u` to upcase a word,{{{
# otherwise readline would execute `upcase-word` after 1s, which is too quick.
