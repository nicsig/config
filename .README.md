# What's the purpose of `.netrc`?

It contains configuration and auto-login information for the FTP client `ftp(1)`.

In particular, it is helpful to avoid having to provide credentials when running
`:VimPatches 8.1` in Vim; otherwise, you would have to type `anonymous` or `ftp`
as a login name, and any non-empty text as a password.

See `man netrc`.

---

In case  you wonder  how we found  that `ftp` and  `anonymous` were  valid login
names for the `ftp.vim.org` machine:

    $ ftp ftp.vim.org
    ...~
    220-You may login as "ftp" or "anonymous".~
    ...~

## Which permissions should the file have?

`600`

> readable for others.  Don't forget that the system administrator can
> still read the file!  Ie. for Linux/Unix: chmod 600 .netrc

## How to get automatic anonymous login to machines not specified in the file?

    $ cat <<'EOF' >>~/.netrc
    default login anonymous password user@site
    EOF

Make sure  the line is  always present at  the end of  the file, after  all more
specific machine lines.

From `man netrc`:

> default   This is the same as machine name except that default matches
>           any name.  There can be only one default token, and it must be
>           after all machine tokens.  This is normally used as:
>
>                 default login anonymous password user@site
>
>           thereby giving the user automatic anonymous ftp login to
>           machines not specified in .netrc.  This can be overridden by
>           using the -n flag to disable auto-login.

## As an alternative to this file, how can I auto-login when `ftp(1)` is invoked by Vim?

You can configure the netrw plugin.

For example:

    $ cat <<'EOF' >>~/.vim/plugin/netrw.vim
    let g:netrw_uid = 'ftp'
    let g:netrw_passwd = '123'
    EOF

See:

   - `:h netrw_uid`
   - `:h netrw_passwd` (you can use the global scope in your config file)
