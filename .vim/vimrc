" Why S-F13..15 ? {{{

" Currently we've decided to assign `S-F13`, `S-F14`, `S-F15` (garbage keys) to
"
"     g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger,
"     g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger,
"     g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger
"
" But in fact, we'll use Tab and S-Tab.
"
" Why S-F13..15 then?
"
" First, because  I'm looking  for unused  keys, which will  stay unused  in the
" future. Currently, the maximum value `xx` to create a <F-xx> {lhs} is `37`:
"
"         https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/8858498516108432453526f07783f14c9196e112/src/keymap.h#L194
"
" Beyond  this value,  creating a  mapping would  shadow the  `<` key,  probably
" because it's not interpreted as a function key anymore.
" We don't need to go as far as 37. On my current keyboard, the biggest function
" key is F12. So, we take our garbage keys from there.
"
" Second, if we assigned Tab / S-Tab, it would make the code more complex.
" Indeed, we would have to:
"
"     1. Capture the output of s:snr() in a global variable (g:snr_vimrc);
"        from our vimrc file.
"
"
"     2. Create the file ~/.vim/after/plugin/ultisnips.vim,
"        in which we would write:
"
"                ino  <silent> <tab>     <c-r>={g:snr_vimrc}expand_cycle_jump('N')<cr>
"                snor <silent> <tab>     <Esc>:call {g:snr_vimrc}expand_cycle_jump('N')<cr>

"                ino  <silent> <s-tab>   <c-r>={g:snr_vimrc}expand_cycle_jump('P')<cr>
"                snor <silent> <s-tab>   <Esc>:call {g:snr_vimrc}expand_cycle_jump('P')<cr>
"
"        Why? Because, by default Ultisnips would install these global mappings:
"
"                i  <tab>       * <c-r>=UltiSnips#ExpandSnippetOrJump()<cr>
"                s  <tab>       * <Esc>:call UltiSnips#ExpandSnippetOrJump()<cr>
"
"        Then during, the expansion of a snippet, it would temporarily install
"        these buffer-local mappings:
"
"                i  <s-tab>     *@<c-r>=UltiSnips#JumpBackwards()<cr>
"                s  <s-tab>     *@<Esc>:call UltiSnips#JumpBackwards()<cr>
"
"        They are removed after the expansion (:h UltiSnips-triggers):
"
"                UltiSnips will only map the jump triggers while a snippet is
"                active to interfere as little as possible with other mappings.
"
"        The first 2 mappings (Tab) call UltiSnips functions which expand a snippet
"        or jump to the next tabstop, but they can't cycle forward inside a menu, nor
"        can they complete text.
"        The last 2 mappings (S-Tab) call UltiSnips functions which jump to the
"        previous tabstop, but they can't cycle backward inside a menu.
"
"        So, we need a wrapper around ultisnips functions.
"
"
"     3. Add this file to the list of (2) files which one of our autocmd resources
"        automatically when we save our vimrc.
"        Why? Because when we save our vimrc, the 2 Tab mappings will be reset by
"        UltiSnips (only after the 1st save it seems…).
"        Specifically because of this file:
"
"                ~/.vim/plugged/ultisnips/autoload/UltiSnips/map_keys.vim
"
"
"     4. Install the following autocmd:
"
"                augroup ultisnips_custom
"                    au!
"                    au! User UltiSnipsEnterFirstSnippet
"                    au User  UltiSnipsEnterFirstSnippet iunmap <buffer> <nowait> <s-tab>
"                augroup END
"
"      Why? Because during the expansion of a snippet, UltiSnips temporarily
"      installs this buffer-local mapping:
"
"                i  <s-tab>     *@<c-r>=UltiSnips#JumpBackwards()<cr>
"
"      This mapping overrides our own global mapping:
"
"                ino  <silent> <s-tab>   <c-r>={g:snr_vimrc}expand_cycle_jump('P')<cr>
"
"      Therefore, we would lose the capacity to cycle backward inside a menu.
"      It would be probably a good idea to also unmap the buffer-local mapping
"      for S-Tab in select mode (although I don't see an immediate pb with
"      UltiSnips overriding our mapping in this case, because there can't be
"      a menu in select mode, so we don't need to cycle back).

" Remove select mode mappings using printable characters {{{

" From :h mapmode-s :
"
"     Some commands work both in Visual and Select mode, some in only one.
"     Note that quite often "Visual" is mentioned where both Visual and Select
"     mode apply.
"     NOTE: Mapping a printable character in Select mode may confuse the user.
"     It's better to explicitly use :xmap, and :smap for printable characters.
"     Or use :sunmap after defining the mapping.
"
" It probably implies that mapping a printable character in select mode is a bad
" idea. For example, suppose that a plugin install this mapping:
"
"     :snor z abc
"
" When the user will hit `z` in select mode, he will expect the selected text
" to be replaced by the `z` character.
" But in fact, the selected text will be replaced with `abc`.
" This unexpected behavior can happen because some plugins use the `:v(nore)map`
" command instead of `:x(nore)map`.
"
" It could pose a pb for UltiSnips, when a tabstop is selected and we hit some
" character to replace the selection.
" Therefore, by default, each time we expand a tab trigger, UltiSnips removes
" all the select mode mappings whose {lhs} is a printable character.

" In particular, don't think  there's any conflict. Both functionalities (window

" clipboard {{{2
" Do NOT tweak this option!
" Why could you be tempted to change the value of this option?{{{
"
" When you use a pasting command,  and you don't specify from which register you

" So, if you want to copy some text from a Vim buffer to Firefox, you'll need to
" explicitly mention the name of the `+` register:
"
"         "+yy
"
" Same thing if you want to paste  in a Vim buffer, some text you've just copied
" in Firefox:
"
"         "+p
"
" It would be convenient to just press `yy` and `p`, and Vim would automatically
" use the system register, instead of the unnamed one.
" That's what 'cb' is for.
"}}}
" How should you change it?{{{
"
"         set clipboard^=unnamedplus
"
" 'cb' contains a comma-separated list of values. Each stands for a register.
" The previous command PREpends `unnamedplus` to this list.
" `unnamedplus` stands for the system register.
"
" Do NOT execute this:
"
"         set clipboard+=unnamedplus
"
" It would APpend the value to the list.
"}}}
" Technically, what happens if you do it?{{{
"
" The system  register register will  now have  a similar (although  not exactly
" identical) behavior than the one of the unnamed:
"
"     • it will contain the text of the last changed register (like `"`)
"
"     •  … except  if  the  last changed  register  was  changed by  a  command
"       containing its explicit name:
"
"               "ayy
"
"       This  is different from `"`,  which always copy  the text of the  last changed
"       register.
"
" If you copy some text in Firefox,  it goes into `+` (regardless of 'cb').  But
" because  of the  new value  of 'cb',  `p` will  automatically paste  `+` (last
" copied text in Firefox).
"
" If you copy  some text in a  Vim buffer, it goes into  `0`. The latter becomes
" the last modified register, and thus  `+` will duplicate its contents (because
" of 'cb').
"
" `"` will still  copy the text of the last changed register:
"
"     set cb^=unnamedplus | let [@+, @"] = ['foo', 'bar'] | norm! p
"           → foo
"
"     set cb&             | let [@+, @"] = ['foo', 'bar'] | norm! p
"           → bar
"}}}
" Are there pitfalls?{{{
"
" Yes a shitload.
"
" 1. It pollutes the system clipboard after every yank, delete, change.
" 2. It may break a plugin which forgets to temporarily reset 'cb' to its default value.
" 3. It may break a plugin, even if it temporarily resets 'cb'.
"
" Example:
" Consider a buffer, with just the text `pat`.
" Execute this command on the line where `pat` is:
"
"         norm ysiw'
"
" vim-surround should surround `pat` with single quotes.
" Undo, and execute:
"
"         g/pat/norm ysiw'
"
" Nothing happens. The issue:
"
"         • does NOT come the fact that vim-surround forgets to temporarily resets 'cb';
"           vim-surround does NOT forget it
"
"         • is fixed if you don't tweak 'cb' (set cb&vim)

" focus to this window.
"}}}

" All buffer related split commands: `:sbuffer`, `:sbnext`, `:sbrewind`…
"}}}
"         Are there pitfalls?{{{

" When we move in the qfl quickly, the focus can change from a window to another
" and it's distracting.
" Besides, once the focus has changed, if  we advance further in the qf list, it
" can make us lose the buffer which was opened in the window.
"
" When we press `C-w CR` on an entry of  the qfl, and the latter is present in a
" buffer which is already displayed somewhere else, Vim opens a split displaying
" an unnamed buffer.
"
" Why?
" Because FIRST it splits the window,  THEN checks whether the buffer to display
" is already displayed  somewhere else. When it finds one, it  changes the focus
" as expected, but it doesn't close the  split with the unnamed buffer (which is
" unexpected).
"
" MWE:
"     vim -Nu NONE -c 'set swb+=useopen' ~/.bashrc

"         Are there workarounds?{{{

" You could temporarily reset 'swb' while:

"         • when you execute some commands / mappings

"           you would need to create wrapper around default normal commands
"           with a try conditional, and a finally clause, to empty 'swb'
"           and/or,
"           you would need to install an autocmd listening to CmdlineLeave,

" timeout {{{2

" enable a timeout for mappings
set timeout

" same thing for keycodes
set ttimeout

" set the timeout for mappings to 3s
set timeoutlen=3000

" … and 6 ms for keycodes.
" Previously we used 50ms, but 6 is the max value to prevent this error:
"
"       1. insert sth wrong
"       2. hit escape
"       3. hit u (undo)    →    M-u: uppercase next word
set ttimeoutlen=6
" the lower the value, the less risk there is for keys manually typed to be
" interpreted as a keycode
"
" E.g.:
" When Vim receives `Esc` then `d`, it has to decide:
"
" does it mean “escape to normal mode“, then “hit the `d` operator“,
" or does it mean `M-d` (delete the next word)?
" If `d` came less than `&ttimeoutlen` ms after `Esc`, Vim will assume it's
" the keycode for `M-d`. Otherwise, it will think we've just manually hit
" `Esc` then `d`.


" Si on a créé un mapping qui à la séquence de touches (keycodes) a et b,
" associe une action, qd on appuiera sur a, Vim attendra un certain temps pour
" nous laisser taper b. Au-delà si l'option 'timeout' est activée, Vim
" exécutera l'action associée à la touche a.
" Cette durée est définie par l'option 'timeoutlen' qui par défaut vaut 1000.
"
" De la même façon, les touches de contrôle produisent souvent une séquence
" d'échappement / de keycodes.
" Pex, F1 produit escape + O + P, on peut vérifier via la commande shell: $ xxd p
"
" Ainsi quand on tape sur escape puis sur O, Vim attend un certain temps avant
" d'ouvrir une nouvelle ligne au-dessus de l'actuelle, pour laisser le temps
" au keycode associé à P d'arriver.
"
" Cette durée est définie par l'option 'ttimeoutlen' qui par défaut vaut -1,
" ce qui signifie qu'elle prend la même valeur que 'timeoutlen', à savoir 1000.
"
" Cette valeur pose pb car elle introduit un délai d'une seconde quand on
" appuie sur escape puis O. Pour résoudre ce pb, on configure 'timeoutlen' à
" 3000 (3s), pour se laisser du temps quand on tape nos mappings, et on
" configure 'ttimeoutlen' à 100 pour raccourcir le délai après un escape + O.
"
" Ça ne devrait pas poser de pb puisqu'aucun de nos mappings ne commence
" par cette séquence de keycodes, par contre il faudra faire attention.
" Dans une session Vim qui tourne sur une machine distante, le lag ou la charge
" de la machine pourrait nous empêcher d'utiliser correctement des touches de
" contrôle (F1, F2, flèches …).
" En effet, 100ms pourrait s'avérer insuffisant pour que l'un des keycodes qui
" compose la séquence arrive à temps.

" ttymouse {{{2

" Pour redimensionner les viewports à la souris, il faut que 'ttymouse' ait pour
" valeur `xterm2` ou `sgr`. Par défaut, sa valeur dépend de `$TERM`.

" Atm, dans xfce4-terminal et dans guake :
"     TERM=xterm ⇒ ttym=sgr
"
" Et dans Tmux :
"     TERM=screen ⇒ ttym=xterm

" Résultat, le redimensionnement des viewports à la souris fonctionne dans Vim
" qd il tourne ds xfce4-terminal et ds guake mais pas dans Tmux.

" Pour résoudre ce pb, le code qui suit vérifie la valeur de l'option term, et
" si elle débute par screen il donne la valeur xterm2 à ttymouse.

" FIXME:
" Is it really still needed?
" It seems we can resize viewports without.

" 3. Hit `a Tab`, to insert the character `a` then try to complete this text.
"
" The result is that the rhs of the `C-x C-k` mapping is inserted into the
" buffer. The reason for this seems to be that `i_C-o` doesn't work as usual
" when we entered insert mode from visual block mode. See our notes for more
" detail on the subject (look for: ’i_C-o’).
"
" Moral of the story:
" Don't use `i_C-o` in a mapping.

" C-t     synonym completion {{{4

" Pb:
" If a synonym contains several words (e.g. important → of vital importance),
" the completion function considers each of them as a distinct synonym.
" Thus, if a synonym contains 3 words, the function populates the popup
" menu with 3 entries.

" Solution:
"         http://stackoverflow.com/a/21132116
"
" Create a  wrapper around  C-x C-t  to temporarily include  the space  and dash
" characters in 'isk'. We'll  remove them as soon as the  completion is done (or
" cancelled).
" It doesn't to seem to affect the completed text, only the synonyms.
" Even with a space in 'isk', the completion function only tries to complete
" the last word before the cursor.

" S-→    C-↑ …        modified arrow keys {{{4

" A terminal emulator gives its name to the programs through the shell
" environment variable $TERM.

" When Vim runs inside a terminal whose name begins with 'xterm' (xterm,
" xterm-256color), it automatically sets up a few keys including the modified
" arrow keys (S-Left, S-Right, C-Up, C-Down …).
"
" However, if the name of the terminal begins with 'screen', it does NOT set
" up those keys.
" For Tmux to function properly, we have configured ~/.shrc so that
" $TERM=screen-256color (in Tmux only, not in basic terminal emulator).
" Because of this, Vim does NOT set up the modified arrow keys when we run it
" inside Tmux. This means we can't map any action to a modified arrow key.
" For example, by default Vim moves the cursor by word in normal mode when we
" hit S-Left / Right.
"
" We need to set up the modified arrow keys ourselves.

" To understand the code, read:
"
"         http://superuser.com/q/401926
"
" :h version7:
"
"         Not all modifiers were recognized for xterm function keys.  Added the
"         possibility in term codes to end in ";*X" or "O*X", where X is any
"         character and the * stands for the modifier code.
"         Added the <xUp>, <xDown>, <xLeft> and <xRight> keys, to be able to
"         recognize the two forms that xterm can send their codes in and still
"         handle all possible modifiers.
"
" The `*` in the next code stands for the modifier `C-`, `S-`, `M-`.
" While the `x` is there because it seems that `xterm` can send codes in
" 2 forms.

"
" … add current line to plus register (`+y` = custom operator, incremental yanking).

" TERMINAL {{{2

" In Vim, we can't use `esc` in the  lhs of a mapping, because any key producing
" a  sequence of  keycodes  containing Esc,  would be  subject  to an  undesired
" remapping (m-b, m-f, left, right, …).
"
" Example:  `M-b`  produce Escape  (go to  Terminal-Normal mode)  + b  (one word
" backward). We DO  want to go one  word backward, but  we also want to  stay in
" Terminal-Job mode.
"
" Neovim doesn't suffer from this issue.
" So, to  go from Terminal-Job mode  to Terminal-Normal mode, we  could use this
" mapping:
"
"         exe 'tno '.(has('nvim') ? '<esc>' : '<esc><esc>').' <c-\><c-n>'
"
" But  I prefer to  stay consistent. Double Escape in  Vim → double  escape in
" neovim.

" Do NOT add this mapping:  tno  <esc>:  <c-\><c-n>:{{{

"     • provide the nr of lines of a block as an argument to the command
"

" How it works?{{{
"
" If the blocks are 5 lines long, the command will execute:

"     ┌───────┤
"     .,.+4g/^/''+5m.|-j

"                   │  └─ then join the two lines
"                   │
"                   └ move the first line of the second block (''+5) under the current one (m.)


" We can notice that the address of the 1st line of the 1st block is expressed
" in 2 different ways, depending on the context.
" Inside the range passed to `:g` it's `.` (current line).
" Inside the command executed by `:g`, it can't be `.` anymore (because the
" current line changes constantly), so here we use `''` instead.
" Indeed, before jumping to the first line to process, `:g` adds an entry in the
" jumplist, whose mark is `''`. So:
"
"             we're on the 1st line of the 1st block
"         and ''    is a line specifier for the latter
"         and a block has 5 lines
"
"         ⇒
"
"         ''+5    is a line specifier for the 1st line of the second block
"
" This shows that the range passed to `:g` is entirely processed BEFORE
" the command (here `:m`) it executes.
" Remember:
" `.` doesn't stand for the same line inside a range passed to `:g`, and inside
" a range passed to a command executed by the same `:g`.


" `:g` will cycle through the lines of the 1st block, and always move + join
" the SAME line:
"
"         the 1st of the 2nd block
"
" But, the contents of this line will constantly change. It will be successively:
"
"     • the 1st of the 2nd block
"     • the 2nd one (after the 1st has been joined)
"     • the 3rd one ("         2nd ")
"     • the 4th one ("         3rd ")
"     • the 5th one ("         4rd ")
"
" Why `-j`, and not simply `j` ?
" Because, when `:m` moves a line, the cursor doesn't stay where it is; it jumps
" onto the moved line.
" So, before joining the lines, we have to get back on the original line above
" (`-` = `.-1`).

    " Why a colon is a bad idea in a filename?{{{
    "
    " 1. It's not inside  the default value of 'isf'. Which means  that Vim
    "    doesn't consider this character  to be a part  of a filename when
    "    using  `\f` in a pattern.
    "
    " 2. In most buffers, the local value of 'efm' probably uses the `%f` item
    "    to match a filename. Here's what `:h error-file-format` says about
    "    the latter:
    "
    "         The "%f" conversion may depend on the current 'isfname' setting.
    "
    "    So, if you  try to parse the output  of a shell command, or  to read an
    "    error file/buffer  to populate the  qfl, Vim  will fail to  recognize a
    "    filename containing a colon. You'll get non-valid entries.
    "
    " 3. It's interpreted as a separator  in $PATH, so it can be dangerous if
    "    used in a directory.  And if we avoid the colon in a directory name,
    "    to stay consistent we should do the same in a filename.
    "
    " 4. It has a special meaning in  Windows, so if the file is copied on
    "    a different OS, it can cause an issue.

" checks for a match against the path as it was typed, not resolved.
"
" It's weird, because according to `:h autocmd-patterns`, Vim should also check

" 1 - write the resolved filename; atm it's:

"     https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728
"     https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/993
"
" To test if true color is enabled:
"     ~/bin/24-bit-color.sh
"
" I've commented every file I could think of (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, ~/.shrc,
" ~/.tmux.conf), and `urxvt` still supports true color inside Tmux, but not
" outside. How is it possible? What's the configuration which enables true
" color in urxvt?
"
" Anyway, it seems that it supports true colors only approximately (→ 256
" palette).
"
" set Vim-specific sequences for RGB colors
"     set termguicolors
"     let &t_8f = "\<Esc>[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum"
"     let &t_8b = "\<Esc>[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum"
"
" But what's the purpose of `truecolors` anyway?
" Look at this colorscheme:
"     https://github.com/ericbn/vim-solarized/blob/master/colors/solarized.vim
"
" It says that it supports true colors, if you enable 'termguicolors'.
" I think that it means that Vim uses `guifg` instead of `ctermfg`, in the
" terminal. The value of `ctermfg` is just a nr between 0 and 15, and probably
" refer to a color of the terminal palette.
" `guifg` is the true color of the colorscheme.
" A terminal that supports true color probably understands the escape
" sequences standing for gui colors …
"
" Other way of explaining this:
" 256 palette = an escape sequence is a code refering to a color in the
" terminal color palette configured by the user
" true color = an escape sequence refers to the hex code of a color; the one
" chosen by the program developer

" In a temporary directory, execute these shell commands:
"     touch file{1..3}; mkdir -p foo/{bar,baz}/{qux,norf}
"     tree -a | vipe
"
" Look at the diagram. Implement a mapping / command which would expand an
" abbreviation into this kind of diagram.
" For the abbreviation, we could take inspiration from the shell commands
" themselves. Or sth else?
"
" A simple way of doing this would be to call just the `tree` command:
"     r !touch file{1..3}; mkdir -p foo/{bar,baz/qux}/{norf,abc}; tree -a
"
"     during the shell expansion `bar` and `baz/qux` are appended to `foo`
"     and `norf` and `abc` are appended to `foo/bar` and `foo/baz/qux`
"     so we end up with 4 (2*2) leaf directories + 4 intermediate directories
"     (foo, bar, baz, qux)
"
" But we would have to create a temporary directory, and temporarily `cd` to it
" to avoid polluting the current working directory.
" Besides, we would have to protect all kind of special characters which could
" be present in the text we want to insert in the diagram.
"
" However, mkdir seems limited to produce a complex hierarchy.
" A better way would be to look at the syntax used by emmet to expand html
" tags. Our mapping/command would parse a similar command to produce
" a hierarchy of items of an arbitrary complexity.
"
" Also, have a look at the DIAGRAM in `:h syntax-loading`. VERY INTERESTING.
" Without this diagram, the explanations would be much more verbose, and less
" readable. Implement a visual mapping, which would automatically draw the
" right diagram in front of the lines inside the selection (drawing `+`, `-`, `|`).
" ~/Desktop/diagram
"
" Also, install mappings to draw vertical diagrams instead of horizontal ones.
" Have a look at our notes about the try conditional for an example where it
" would be useful.
"
" Try this:
"

"             start -> adsuck;
"             adsuck -> block;
"             block -> noop[label="yes"];
"             block -> unbound[label="no"];
"             noop -> serve_noop[label="yes"];
"             noop -> serve_empty[label="no"];
"         }
"
" Visually select it, and type:
"
"         :'<,'>!graph-easy --as ascii
"                                      ^
"                                      don't add `%`
"                                      it would work, but if you have several digraph codes
"                                      in the current file, they will ALL be expanded, even
"                                      if you only select one in particular

" Tweak the function so that we can interrupt it with C-c.

"
" Also, read this (taken from vim-surround note), and try to reimplement it:
"
"     Au moment d'encadrer un text-object, on peut également interroger
"     l'utilisateur via un prompt pour lui permettre d'insérer une chaîne de
"     caractères arbitraire:
"
"             let g:surround_108 = "\1Enter sth: \1 \r \1\1"
"
"     `\r` permet de se référer au texte à remplacer (un peu comme & dans une
"     substitution).
"     Le prompt sera peuplé avec ’Enter sth: ’, et la chaîne saisie sera insérée
"     entre chaque paire consécutive de `\1 … \1`.
"     On ne peut pas se référer plusieurs fois au texte d'origine.
"     IOW, on ne peut pas utiliser plusieurs fois `\r`.
"     Le 1er sera bien remplacé par le text-object d'origine. Mais les autres
"     seront traduits en CR littéraux.
"     Il est nécessaire d'utiliser des doubles quotes.
"     On peut utiliser jusqu'à 7 input différents:
"
"             let g:surround_108 = "\1Enter sth: \1 \r \2And sth else: \2"
"
"     Ajouter des exemples …
"     https://stackoverflow.com/a/47401509/8243465
"
"
"
"     Furthermore, one can specify a regular expression substitution to apply.
"
"           let g:surround_108 = "\\begin{\1environment: \1}\r\\end{\1\r}.*\r\1}"
"           let g:surround_108 = "\1Enter sth: \1 \r \1\r}.*\r\1"
"
"     This will remove anything after the first } in the input when the text is
"     placed within the \end{} slot.  The first \r marks where the pattern begins,
"     and the second where the replacement text begins.
"
"     Les 2 derniers `\r` sont équivalents à `\zs` et `\ze`.
"     Tout ce qui se situe entre eux est supprimé.
"
"     Here's a second  example for creating an HTML <div>.  The substitution prompts
"     for an id, but only adds id="" if it is non-blank.
