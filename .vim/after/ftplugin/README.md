# Should I write a guard in one of my ftplugins?

No.

When your ftplugin will be sourced, a previous one:

        $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/{filetype}.vim

... will already have set the variable `b:did_ftplugin` (hit `gF`).

So, if you write a guard, it will prevent your ftplugin from being FULLY sourced:

        " ✘
        if exists('b:did_ftplugin')
            finish
        endif
        let b:did_ftplugin = 1


# Should I create `b:did_ftplugin` in one of my ftplugins?

The purpose  of `b:did_ftplugin` is to  prevent any other filetype  plugins from
being sourced afterwards.

So, if your ftplugin is in an `after/` directory, the answer is:

        NO, don't create `b:did_ftplugin`

Otherwise, yes.

# Should I delete `b:did_ftplugin` or `b:undo_ftplugin`?

No.

Vim will do it automatically:

        $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin.vim:17

# Can I define a function in one of my ftplugins?

No.

It should be in an `autoload/` directory.

You can either use `~/.vim/autoload/`, or the `autoload/` directory of an ad hoc
plugin (with a `ftplugin/`, and maybe `syntax/`, `indent/`, ...
directories).
