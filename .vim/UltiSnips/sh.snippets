# To document:
#
#         `vim.current.window.cursor[0]` can be used to access the line number.
#         Is it equivalent to `snip.line`, or is there an offset?
#
#         `post_expand`  works only  if the  first  tabstop is  right after  the
#         tab_trigger of the second snippet.
#
#         `post_jump` works  on the  condition that the  first tabstop  is right
#         after the tab_trigger  of the second snippet, and you  test the number
#         of the tabstop before trying to expand the snippet:
#
#                 post_jump "if snip.tabstop == 1: vim.eval('feedkeys(\"\<c-r>=UltiSnips#ExpandSnippet()\<cr>\")')"
#                            ├──────────────────┘
#                            └ check we're on the first tabstop,
#                              because we've positioned the tab_trigger
#                              right before
#
#         You could position the tab_trigger of the second snippet before any
#         tabstop, not just the first one, but then its expansion wouldn't be
#         completely automatic. You would have to jump to it.
#         There's no need for that with the first tabstop, because UltiSnips
#         automatically jumps to the first tabstop after expanding a snippet.
