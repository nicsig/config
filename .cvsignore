# What's this file?{{{
#
# A global `.gitignore` for patterns matching file names we never want to track,
# no matter the project.
#}}}
# What's the default location for such a file?{{{
#
# Whatever path is contained in the value of `core.excludesfile`:
#
#     $ git config --global core.excludesfile
#
# By default, it should be:
#
#     ~/.config/git/ignore
#}}}
# Ok, so why do you use `~/.cvsignore` instead of this default path?{{{
#
# That's what tpope recommends in the README file for pathogen.
#
# > I'll teach you how to ignore tags globally:
#
#     $ git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.cvsignore'
#     $ echo tags >> ~/.cvsignore
#
# > While any filename will work, I've chosen to follow the ancient tradition of
# > .cvsignore because utilities like rsync use it, too.

# Some of your globs don't begin with a star. Does Git add one automatically?{{{
#
# No.
# If there's no star, it simply means we don't need one.
#
# Example:
#
#     .DS_Store
#
# This matches a file whose name is `.DS_Store`.
# A file  named `foo.DS_Store` would  not be affected  by this glob,  and that's
# expected.
# `.DS_Store` is a file created automatically by macOS, not `foo.DS_Store`.
